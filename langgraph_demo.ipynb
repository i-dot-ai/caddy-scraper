This is called\\ngiving you notice.\\nHow much notice they give you will depend on your supplier - it could be\\nbetween 3 and 10 days. You can find out how much notice your supplier will\\ngive by contacting them or checking your contract.\\nYou should [complain to your supplier](/consumer/energy/energy-\\nsupply/complain-about-an-energy-company/complain-to-your-energy-supplier/) if\\nyou think they haven’t given you reasonable notice.\\nIf you’re struggling to pay your energy bills or top up your prepayment meter\\nyou might be able to get extra help. [Check if you can get grants and benefits\\nto help pay your energy bills](/consumer/energy/energy-supply/get-help-paying-\\nyour-bills/grants-and-benefits-to-help-you-pay-your-energy-bills/).\\n## If you’re on a fixed tariff\\nYour supplier can’t increase the price you pay, unless the government has\\nraised VAT.\\nYour energy bill can still go up and down. The amount you’re charged is set by\\nthe amount of energy you use, the unit cost and the daily fee. The unit cost\\nof your energy and the daily fee are fixed.\\nIf you’re not sure if you’re on a fixed tariff, check your bill. If it says\\nyour contract has an end date, this means you’re on a fixed tariff.\\nFixed tariffs usually last for a year.\\n### If your direct debit payments have increased\\nYour payments have probably gone up because you’re using more energy than your\\nsupplier expected.

You might also find details about CSP in your staff\\nhandbook or intranet.\\nIf your employer doesn’t pay CSP then you should get SSP from day 4 of being\\noff sick.\\n## Check if you can get SSP in your situation\\nThe SSP rules can change depending on your situation.\\n###  You’re self-isolating because of coronavirus\\nThe government have ended the laws about self-isolating. This means you don't\\nlegally have to self-isolate, but the government still recommend you self-\\nisolate if you test positive for coronavirus.\\nIf you’re able to work, you don’t have the right to get SSP just because\\nyou’re self-isolating or you’ve got coronavirus. It’s worth speaking to your\\nemployer - they might agree to let you take paid sick leave.\\nIf you’re too ill to work, the normal rules about getting SSP apply.\\n###  You want to work less hours after illness or surgery\\nIf you’ve been off work for surgery or a long illness, you might want to work\\nless hours for a while - for example, working 3 days a week instead of your\\nnormal 5 days a week. This is called a ‘phased return’ to work.\\nYour doctor can write a fit note that recommends you work less hours a week,\\nwhile you recover.\\n### Work out your pay and sick pay while working less hours\\nYou should get your normal pay on the days you work and SSP on the days you\\ndon’t work. You have to have 4 days in a row off sick to get SSP - this\\nincludes Saturday and Sunday. So you might want to take Monday and Tuesday as\\nyour sick leave days.\\nIf you only take 1 day as your sick leave day, you won’t get SSP for that day.\\nFor example, you take Monday as your sick leave day and work Tuesday to\\nFriday.\\nYour pay might be less while you work less hours. You might also get less SSP\\nand CSP. You should discuss with your employer what your pay, SSP and CSP will\\nbe during your phased return - it’s a good idea to get this in writing.\\n###  You're pregnant\\nIf you can get sick pay depends on if your illness is related to your\\npregnancy or not.\\nYou can [read more on getting sick pay when you’re pregnant](/work/sick-leave-\\nand-sick-pay/getting-sick-pay-when-youre-pregnant/).\\n###  You're returning to work after getting maternity pay\\nIf you become sick before or during your maternity pay period you won't get\\nSSP until 8 weeks after your maternity pay ends.\\nIf you become sick after your maternity pay period ends you can get statutory\\nsick pay if you're entitled.\\n###  You're in hospital\\nIf you’re eligible for SSP you should get it during any time you have to stay\\nin hospital.\\nIf you’re in hospital to have planned surgery, you should still get SSP for\\nyour time in hospital and your recovery time at home. Planned surgery is also\\ncalled ‘elective surgery’.\\nYou should check your contract and staff handbook to see if you can also get\\nContractual Sick Pay (CSP) for elective surgery.\\n###  You have more than 1 employer\\nIf you have more than 1 employer you can get SSP from each one. Treat each\\nemployer as if they were your only employer to see if they should pay you SSP.\\nIf your illness means you can do 1 of your jobs but not the other, you could\\nget SSP from 1 while getting your normal wages from the other. You should ask\\nyour doctor to explain this on your fit note.\\n###  You're getting your pension\\nIf you work and get your State Pension or a workplace pension, you can still\\nget SSP.\\nIf you can’t get SSP you might be able to get Pension Credit. You can [check\\nif you can get Pension Credit](/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/pension-\\ncredit/before-you-claim-pension-credit/check-if-you-can-get-pension-credit/).\\nIf you have a disability or illness that makes it hard for you to look after\\nyourself, you might also be able to get Attendance Allowance.

They\\nshould give you this on a form called ‘statutory sick pay and an employee's\\nclaim for benefit (SSP1)’. You should be given the form within 7 days of you\\ngoing off sick. You’ll need the SSP1 form to claim benefits.\\nIf your employer hasn’t given you form SSP1, you should first ask them for a\\nwritten statement explaining why you can’t get SSP.

       " Document(metadata={'source_url': 'https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/get-advance-payment/', 'markdown_length': 7073, 'raw_markdown': \"#  Get an advance payment of Universal Credit\\nThis advice applies to England.  See advice for [See advice for Northern\\nIreland](/northern-ireland/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/get-advance-\\npayment/), [See advice for Scotland](/scotland/benefits/universal-\\ncredit/claiming/get-advance-payment/), [See advice for\\nWales](/wales/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/get-advance-payment/)\\nYou can ask for an advance payment of Universal Credit to help you get by\\nwhile you're waiting for your first payment. You can also ask for an advance\\npayment if [your circumstances have changed](/benefits/universal-credit/what-\\nyoull-need-to-do-on-universal-credit/check-if-a-change-affects-your-universal-\\ncredit/) and you expect your Universal Credit payments to increase.\\nWithout an advance payment you usually won’t get any money until at least 5\\nweeks after you apply for Universal Credit.\\nYou should ask for an advance payment if you don’t think you’ll have enough\\nmoney to live on between when you apply and when you get your first payment.\\nThe advance payment is a loan - you’ll have to pay it back, but you won’t need\\nto pay any interest.\\n## Getting an advance payment\\nYou can ask for an advance payment by:\\n  * asking your work coach at your first Universal Credit interview\\n  * applying through your online account\\n  * calling the Universal Credit helpline\\nYou can’t ask for an advance online or by calling the helpline unless you’ve\\nhad your first Universal Credit interview - [find out how to book your\\nUniversal Credit interview](/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/going-to-your-\\ninterview/).\\nThe DWP will tell you if you can get an advance payment - you’ll usually find\\nout on the same day you ask for it.\\nOnce the DWP have agreed to an advance payment you should get the money in 3\\nworking days. Tell the DWP if you need it sooner than this - they can pay you\\non the same day if you’d have no other money to live on.\\nThe DWP will pay the advance into the same bank account you’re using for your\\nUniversal Credit claim.\\nYou can ask for up to a month of your Universal Credit entitlement. You don’t\\nhave to ask for your full entitlement - you can ask for less. If you decide\\nyou need more, you can ask for a second payment but you’ll have to explain why\\nyou need it. The first and second payments added together can’t add up to more\\nthan your monthly entitlement.\\nExample\\nSam's monthly entitlement is £500. He asks his work coach for an advance of\\n£200 - he can ask later for a second payment but won’t get more than £300.\\nTalk to your work coach about how much you can ask for. You'll pay your\\nadvance back through monthly deductions from your Universal Credit. Ask your\\nwork coach how much the deductions will be.\\nIf you borrow a whole month's payment make sure you keep some back to pay your\\nrent. Rent is included in your Universal Credit payment - it isn't usually\\npaid straight to your landlord.\\n## If you've already had your interview\\nYou can phone the Universal Credit helpline to ask for an advance payment or\\napply through your online account. You can ask up to 1 month after you apply\\nfor Universal Credit.\\nIt’s best to ask as soon as possible. Once you claim Universal Credit it will\\ntake at least 5 weeks for you to get your first payment. You'll need to think\\nabout how much money you'll need until your first payment.\\n**Universal Credit helpline**\\nTelephone: 0800 328 5644\\nTelephone (Welsh language): 0800 328 1744\\nTextphone: 0800 328 1344\\nRelay UK - if you can't hear or speak on the phone, you can type what you want\\nto say: 18001 then 0800 328 5644\\nYou can use Relay UK with an app or a textphone. There’s no extra charge to\\nuse it.

It’s\\nstill best if she asks as soon as possible, so she can get her money sooner.\\n## Repaying the advance payment\\nThe DWP will automatically take repayments from your Universal Credit until\\nyou’ve paid the advance back. You’ll need to agree with the DWP about how much\\nthe repayments will be and how long it will take to repay them.\\nIf you applied for an advance on or after 12 April 2021, you can spend up to\\n24 months paying it back. If you applied before then, you can spend up to 12\\nmonths paying it back.\\nThe DWP shouldn’t ask you to pay it back sooner if you can’t afford it - tell\\nyour work coach if the repayments will cause you hardship. You can ask to pay\\nit back quicker if you want to.\\n## If you're refused an advance payment\\nYou can ask the DWP to look at the decision again if they won’t give you an\\nadvance payment. It will help if you can give new evidence or show that your\\ncircumstances have changed since your first request.\\nIf you're struggling to get by, [check what extra help you can get](/debt-and-\\nmoney/cost-of-living/get-help-with-the-cost-of-living/).\\nYou can read more advice about [getting help with your living costs](/debt-\\nand-money/budgeting1/).\\n## If you're in debt or rent arrears\\nThere are some [steps you can take to help you reduce your\\ndebt](/benefits/universal-credit/on-universal-credit/universal-credit-debt-\\nrent-arrears/) if you've just applied for Universal Credit.\\nYou can also read our [advice on dealing with debt](/debt-and-money/help-with-\\ndebt/).\\n## If you’re struggling with costs\\nYou might be able to get help from your local council or an interest-free loan\\nfrom the government.
